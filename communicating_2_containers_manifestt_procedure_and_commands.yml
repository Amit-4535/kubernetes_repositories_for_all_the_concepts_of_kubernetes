Communicating 2 containers to each others..
Manifest file to communicate 2 containers to each others..

kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mydemopods

spec:
  containers:
    - name: c00
      image: ubuntu
      command:
         [
          "/bin/bash",
          "-c",
          "apt update && apt install -y python3 && python3 -m http.server 8080"
         ]
      ports:
      - containerPort: 8080

    - name: co1
      image: nginx
      ports:
      - containerPort: 80

-	kubectl get pods
-	kubectl describe pods podid
(you will get 2 containers are running inside the containers field in the description), we have another below advanced command as well to describe which all pods are running inside the containers.
-	kubectl get pod mydemopods -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].name}'
-	kubectl exec -it podname -- /bin/bash
(to go inside the pods – you will be switching to default containers, in our case c00 is the default container)
-	kubectl exec podname -it -c containername -- /bin/bash
(to go inside the particular container)
-	apt-get update && apt-get install curl
(install the curl and update your system – to check that 2 containers are talking to each others)
-	curl localhost:80
(you will see that you will get the output from the another container)

You can check this as well by going to another container and can follow the similar steps..


Notes –
share the same network namespace
Every Pod has:
•	one IP address
•	one network namespace
•	one localhost
•	one set of ports
Even if the Pod has multiple containers, Kubernetes gives the entire Pod only one IP.
They share the same localhost (127.0.0.1)
They share the same network interfaces
Ports are shared across containers
If:
•	c00 binds to port 8080
•	co1 binds to port 80
Then the Pod's network looks like:
localhost:80   → nginx (co1)
localhost:8080 → python/http server (c00)
This is why:
•	c00 → curl localhost:80 (works)
•	co1 → curl localhost:8080 (works once server is running)
✔️ Analogy
A Pod is like a house.
Inside the house:
•	Each container is a room.
•	All rooms share the same address.
•	If one room (container) opens a door on port 80, everyone else in the house can use it.
